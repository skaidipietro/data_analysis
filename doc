1.Forecasting

Forecasting is used for predicting the future direction of trend by using some of the previous data,
here we can use the sales records of bananas in previous weeks to estimate the sales of bananas in
the next week.
2.Anomaly Detection
Anomaly detection is used to find thing unusual happened and quite different with expected
patterns. Here we determine whether this bank card is stolen by comparing the past purchase
records with our expected trend. If a purchase record seriously deviates from our expected trend, it
means that the credit card is likely to be stolen.
3.Recommendation systems
Recommendation systems is the things like filter, it can use what user often look at and the
suggestions by other users to find the most relevant thing to the user. Therefore, we can find out
what content best meets the user's preferences and viewing habits through this recommendation
system.
4.Risk prediction
Risk prediction is the use of various factors to analyse and predict the probability of a person's risk
events. Here we using genomic and lifestyle factors which both can increase the probability of
contracting breast cancer to determine the chance of an individual contracting breast cancer in the
next year.

1.
So what we have now is:
R=0 R=1 R=2 Total
H=0 2 8 9 19
H=1 5 2 12 19
Total 7 10 21 38(total game)
Then we can get:
P(R=0) P(R=1) P(R=2) P(Total)
P(H=0) 2/38=1/19 8/38=4/19 9/38 19/38=1/2
P(H=1) 5/38 2/38=1/19 12/38=6/19 19/38=1/2
P(Total) 7/38 10/38=5/19 21/38 38/38=1
2. P(R=2)=9/38+12/38=21/38
3. P(R=2|H=1)= P(R=2,H=1)/P(H=1)=(12/38)/(19/38)=12/19
4. P(R=2|H=0)= P(R=2,H=0)/P(H=0)=(9/38)/(19/38)=9/19
5.
Yes I do believe that Barcelona is more likely to win when at home versus when they play away,
because probability that Barcelona will win a game when playing at home is 12/19 which is greater
than probability that Barcelona will win a game when playing away 9/19.

Here we want get probability that they will not lose two out of three of these games, so we just need
to know probability that they will not lose all three games and probability that they will only lose one
game and probability of all lost.
probability that they will lose the away game:
P(R=0|H=0)=P(R=0,H=0)/P(H=0)=(2/38)/(19/38)=2/19
probability that they will lose the at home game:
P(R=0|H=1)=P(R=0,H=1)/P(H=1)=(5/38)/(19/38)=5/19
probability that they will lose no game: (1-2/19)*(1-5/19)*(1-2/19)=4046/6859
probability that they will lose first game: (2/19)*(1-5/19)*(1-2/19)=476/6859
probability that they will lose second game: (1-2/19)*(5/19)*(1-2/19)=1445/6859
